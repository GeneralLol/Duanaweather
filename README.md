# Project_Oracle
## Objective: 
To create a piece of software that is able to pull weather information and display it through the serial port of a Raspberry Pi. 

## Setup: 
  1. Setup the Serial communication on the Raspberry Pi
  2. Connect the Serial display to the Raspberry Pi. 
  3. Download the project files into one folder. 
  4. Run CentralModule with python3. 
 
 ## End Result: 
 The program should display date, time, weather and temperature on the display selected.  
 
 ## OS Support: 
 Currently this project only supports Linux. It is made and tested on Ubuntu. Other distros have not been tested. Windows will totally not work unless the pahts and command prompt commands in the python files are changed to adapt to the system. 

 ## Current Issues:
 Drivers for physical displays are still non-existent. 
 
 The Calendar Module is still work in progress. 
 
 The program currently doesn't work on a Raspberry Pi. Reasons unknown. 
 
 The Virtual Display takes up WAY too much CPU time. Don't know why yet.
